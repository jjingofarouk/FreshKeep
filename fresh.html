            <h2>The food waste pandemic</h2>
            <p class="area"><p>How widespread is it?</p> <p>Food waste in Sub-Saharan Africa is rapidly rising, coinciding with a rapid population increase. It is more prominent in households than in restaurants, schools, and produce markets. Ugandan households, institutions, and produce markets reported a weekly food waste occurrence of 96%, 72%, and 93%, generating an average of 680, 80, and 8 tons of food waste daily respectively. Ugandans continue to view food waste as a serious challenge that must urgently be addressed, and view food waste as a valuable resource for producing useful things like livestock feed. In East Africa, food waste from markets accounts for 65-79% of the total biological waste in major cities.</p>

                <p>FreshKeep was conceived to tackle a pressing issue of food waste in Uganda. Recognizing the severe environmental, economic, and social impacts of food spoilage, we envisioned a sustainable solution: to create an intelligent storage and drying system. FreshKeep aims to extend the shelf life of farm produce through real-time monitoring, humidity, and temperature control, and the application of an organic formula. Our approach combines innovative technology with community engagement to create a long-lasting impact.</p>
